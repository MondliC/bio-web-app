<p>⚠️ This Was a Phishing Simulation
You’ve just learned how easy it is to be tricked by a convincing message.

But don’t worry — this was only a test, designed to help you recognize and avoid real phishing attacks in the future.

🛡️ How to Protect Yourself
Think before you click: Hover over links to check where they lead.
Verify the sender: Don’t trust display names — check the full email address.
Watch for urgency: Phishing emails often try to create panic or pressure.
Don’t share sensitive info: Never enter passwords or personal data on suspicious sites.
Report it: If something feels off, report it to your IT or security team.
Stay alert. Stay informed. Stay secure.
Cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility.</p>
